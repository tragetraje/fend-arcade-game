===============================

You can play my basic version of classic Arcade game Frogger [here] (tragetraje.github.io/fend-arcade-game)

Use arrow keys to make your way to the water while avoiding the crossing bugs, collision with them resets the game

Students should use this [rubric](https://www.udacity.com/course/viewer/#!/c-nd001/l-2696458597/m-2687128535) for self-checking their submission.
